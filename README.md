# ADTOF

`Automatic Drum Transcription On Fire (ADTOF)` is an effort to list existing formats of drum transcriptions available online and utilize them as ADT training data by converting them to a standard MIDI file aligned to an audio file.

Right now, we offer to convert charts from the game Phase Shift to an easy to use file format.
